        "The original `mod_five_heuristic` is **admissible**, meaning it never overestimates the true cost to reach the goal. However, when we apply a weight \\($\\alpha$\\), the heuristic may lose this property. If \\($\\alpha$\\) is too large, the heuristic could overestimate the number of moves, making it no longer admissible.\n",
